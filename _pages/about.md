I'm Ekaterina (Kath), and I am a [Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow](https://cires.colorado.edu/about/institutional-programs/visiting-fellows-program) at the [Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science](https://cires.colorado.edu/) at University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [Cornell University](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam). I've used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena -- from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system. I am bringing these interests together by building a model public support for climate policy. I am passionate about complex social systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.
