- Instructor, M14095: Mathematical Models and How to Build One, Summer 2020

    - Designed and taught a six-session online class in mathematical modeling for high school students. Topics included: the basics of modeling, population dynamics (predator-prey and language competition), stochastic modeling, evolutionary dynamics and game theory. The material was taught using Jupyter notebooks. Students completed a group capstone project. Contact me for any materials. ​
