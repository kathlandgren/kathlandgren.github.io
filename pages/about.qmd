I am originally from Moscow, Russia. As of 2024, I spent more half of my life in the United States. For more than a decade, I was an international student on an F-1 visa. Its description of me as a "visitor" and the associated sense of precarity has shaped my perspective on the world around me, as well as my complicated sense of home and belonging.  

I live in Boulder, CO: a place where I got to fulfill my two longstanding dreams of having a cat and a fireplace. 

I am a strong believer in what Kieran Setiya calls "atelic activities", meaning that their meaning isn't derived from the ultimate aim. I love the following activities, and I resist the occasional urges to optimize (or, god forbid, monetize) them: calligraphy, journaling, sketching, weightlifting, baking, playing guitar, reading making linocut prints, learning languages. Colorado has turned me into a hiker and a skier. The following things bring me inordinate amounts joy but don't feel like they fit in the category of hobbies: tea, making lists, going to concerts.
