I'm Ekaterina (Kath),  and I am a Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at University of Colorado Boulder. I work with [Matt Burgess](https://www.mattgburgess.ca). Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University. I've used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena -- from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system.  Currently I am bringing these interests together by investigating social aspects of climate change. This work combines two fundamental questions in my research: How do we move society toward large-scale solutions to the climate crisis? How does one’s position within a system influence their view of it? I am passionate about complex systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.

**In Fall 2025, I will be joining the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability as a Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellow. I will be working with [Sara Constantino](https://www.saraconstantino.org/) and [Madalina Vlasceanu](https://climatecognition.stanford.edu/). **
