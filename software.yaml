  title: "SWAMPE: a Shallow-Water Atmospheric Model in Python for Exoplanets"
  description: |
    SWAMPE is a 2D shallow-water general circulation model designed for simulating exoplanet atmospheres. 
    
    SWAMPE is a fully in Python implementation of a spectral algorithm previously available only in Fortran.
    
    SWAMPE is tuned for synchronously rotating hot Jupiters and sub-Neptunes, and can be easily adapted to model a variety of substellar objects.
