Topics included: the basics of modeling, population dynamics (predator-prey and language competition), stochastic modeling, evolutionary dynamics and game theory. The material was taught using Jupyter notebooks. Students completed a group capstone project. Contact me for any materials.\n\n\n\n​"

    "text": "I’m Ekaterina (I go by Kath), and I am a Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University. I’ve used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena – from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system. I am bringing these interests together by building a model of how public support for climate policy can be influenced by migration and strategic investment in clean energy. I am interested in investigating strategies to overcome political polarization in the U.S. I am passionate about complex systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.\nI live in Boulder, CO, and in my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, hiking, skiing, and playing guitar (not well)."

I work with Matt Burgess. Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University. I’ve used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena – from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system. Currently I am bringing these interests together by investigating social aspects of climate change. This work combines two fundamental questions in my research: How do we move society toward large-scale solutions to the climate crisis? How does one’s position within a system influence their view of it? I am passionate about complex systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.\nI am on the job market in Fall 2024! Please reach out if you’d like to chat!\nFor more about me, see my bio, CV, or list of publications."
