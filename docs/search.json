    "text": "I’m Ekaterina (Kath), and I am a Postdoctoral Visiting Fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at University of Colorado Boulder. I work with Matt Burgess. Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University. I’ve used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena – from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system. Currently I am bringing these interests together by investigating social aspects of climate change. This work combines two fundamental questions in my research: How do we move society toward large-scale solutions to the climate crisis? How does one’s position within a system influence their view of it? I am passionate about complex systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.\nI am on the job market in Fall 2024! Please reach out if you’d like to chat!\nFor more about me, see my CV, or list of publications."

    "text": "I am originally from Moscow, Russia. As of 2024, I spent more half of my life in the United States. For more than a decade, I was an international student on an F-1 visa. Its description of me as a “visitor” and the associated sense of precarity has shaped my perspective on the world around me, as well as my complicated sense of home and belonging.\nI live in Boulder, CO: a place where I got to fulfill my two longstanding dreams of having a cat and a fireplace.\nI am a strong believer in what Kieran Setiya calls “atelic activities”, meaning that their meaning isn’t derived from the ultimate aim. I love the following activities, and I resist the occasional urges to optimize (or, god forbid, monetize) them: calligraphy, journaling, sketching, weightlifting, baking, playing guitar, reading making linocut prints, learning languages. Colorado has turned me into a hiker and a skier. The following things bring me inordinate amounts joy but don’t feel like they fit in the category of hobbies: tea, making lists, going to concerts."
