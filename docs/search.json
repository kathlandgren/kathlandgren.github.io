    "text": "Misperception of Public Support of Climate Policy\nClimate change policies are popular, but their popularity is chronically underestimated, creating a barrier to building coalitions to implement such policies. Previous research has suggested possible mechanisms to explain this mismatch, including media biases and self-censorship within politically conservative communities, but these have not been explicitly tested. I am testing for these mechanisms using a combination of modeling and data analyses, including the development of a human-annotated dataset on climate coverage in news media.\nOur key takeaways are that:\n\nhomophily or echo chamber effects alone are not sufficient to explain widespread misperception,\nin TV news, opposition to climate policy is more frequent than opposition to climate concern, and\nsurprisingly, we do not find evidence supporting media bias as an explanation for misperception of climate policy support: the ratio of expressed support to opposition aligns with the views of the American public.\n\n\nTo find out more, check out the slides from my talk at NetSci2024 or the recording from the seminar I gave at the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Draft available upon request.\n\n\n​Optimal Ambition in Politics, Business, and Life\nHow ambitious should one be? When should we be satisfied and when should we look for greener pastures? When is the perfect the enemy of the good? This type of question arises in many different contexts, including business, politics, and many aspects of our personal lives. We construct a simple model where agents draw random rewards from an underlying distribution. Each agent has a satisfaction threshold and finite search time. We investigate how the optimal satisfaction threshold (i.e. the one that maximizes cumulative reward) depends on the properties of the reward landscape and on what information the agents receive about available rewards.\nOur key insights are that:\n\ncompared to the optimal threshold, being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious, and\ncomparing one’s performance to those who are doing better can actually hurt one’s expected reward in the long run.\n\nWe apply these insights by mapping the reward landscapes of political polling and the stock market. Draft available upon request.\n\n\nOngoing collaborations\nBeyond the above, I am involved in several ongoing collaborations. Please reach out if you would like to chat about these projects.\n\nmodeling social (i.e. beyond economic) aspects of gentrification processes,\ndescribing the publication preferences of academics,\nanalyzing climate change polarization on Reddit."

    "text": "I am originally from Moscow, Russia. As of 2024, I spent more half of my life in the United States. For more than a decade, I was an international student on an F-1 visa. Its description of me as a “visitor” and the associated sense of precarity has shaped my perspective on the world around me, as well as my complicated sense of home and belonging.\nI live in Boulder, CO: a place where I got to fulfill my two longstanding dreams of having a cat and a fireplace.\nI am a strong believer in what Kieran Setiya calls “atelic activities”, meaning that their meaning isn’t derived from the ultimate aim. I love the following activities, and I resist the occasional urges to optimize (or, god forbid, monetize) them: calligraphy, journaling, sketching, weightlifting, baking, playing guitar, reading making linocut prints, learning languages. Colorado has turned me into a hiker and a skier. The following things bring me inordinate amounts joy but don’t feel like they fit in the category of hobbies: tea, making lists, going to concerts."

I work with Matt Burgess. Prior to joining CIRES, I received a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University. I’ve used dynamical systems models to study a wide range of phenomena – from voter turnout to planets beyond our solar system. Currently I am bringing these interests together by investigating social aspects of climate change. This work combines two fundamental questions in my research: How do we move society toward large-scale solutions to the climate crisis? How does one’s position within a system influence their view of it? I am passionate about complex systems, open science, and interdisciplinary research.\nI am on the job market in Fall 2024!
